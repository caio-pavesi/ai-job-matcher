# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,
Having spent a significant part of my early career at BMW, I’ve come to see it not just as a workplace, but as the environment where I want to grow, lead, and contribute long-term. I even turned down a promotion at a prestigious investment firm to return to the company, motivated by my ambition to one day take on a leadership role within BMW. Gaining experience in our global operations is the next strategic step on that path.
What sets me apart is not just technical fluency, but the ability to connect it with business needs. At BMW, I develop tools used by directors, managers and analysts, collaborate in problem solving with colleagues across plants, support improvements that directly impact hundreds of employees. And previously, at an investment firm, I helped automate workflows supporting R$15B in assets, delivering results and increasing efficiency in a fast-paced, high-stakes environment.
I also bring hands-on leadership. As administrative manager of my university’s BAJA SAE team, I secured R$50K in sponsorships and led our team to a national 5th place finish in management, among 60+ teams. That experience strengthened my skills in strategic thinking, communication, and performance under pressure.
BMW’s culture of quality, high performance, innovation, and social responsibility aligns closely with my own values. I’d welcome the opportunity to contribute to your team and support the company’s objectives. Thank you for considering my application, please feel free to contact me via Teams, phone, or email.
Best regards,
Caio Pavesi
