You are an expert hiring manager. You will be given two texts:

(1) **Job Description:** ```{{JOB_DESCRIPTION}}```
(2) **Candidate Application:** ```{{CANDIDATE_APPLICATION}}```

Evaluate how well this candidate matches the job. Consider:
- **Skills and keywords:** Does the resume mention the hard/soft skills and tools listed in the JD?
- **Role alignment:** Do the candidate’s past titles, responsibilities, and experience level fit the role?
- **Achievements/Impact:** Does the candidate list quantified results or strong accomplishments?
- **Education/Certifications:** Are the required degrees or certifications present?
- **Industry/Company fit:** Has the candidate worked in this industry or similar companies?
- **Language quality & structure:** Is the resume clear, free of typos/grammar errors, and well-formatted (not too cluttered)?
- **Red flags:** Watch for frequent job changes, unexplained gaps, vague statements, or misalignments.

**Output Requirements:**
After your analysis, **output only valid JSON** with the following keys (no extra keys or explanation):
```json
{
  "score": <integer 0–100>,                 // overall match (100 = perfect fit)
  "strengths": "<text>",                   // key strengths (bullet list or concise summary)
  "weaknesses": "<text>",                  // key weaknesses or gaps
  "improvement_points": "<text>",          // suggestions to improve fit (skills or experience to add)
  "conclusion": "<text>"                   // one-sentence verdict on fit (e.g. 'strong fit' or 'poor fit')
}
```
