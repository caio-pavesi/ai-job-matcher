# Ai job matching
How do companies match the best candidates betwenn hundreds of them? Not manually!

## Objective
With this repository you have a glance at an [automation](/source/etl.ipynb) that scraps a given job portal for all of the postings. Then it [compares](/source/match.ipynb) a given candidate application files (PDF's) with a job description using a OpenAi's API.

This is an example only if you want to use with your use case (e.g other job portal you'll need to adapt the code for your needs)
