He has demonstrated hands-on project management, leadership, and cross-functional teamwork, as well as strong communication skills, as evidenced by multiple recommendation letters. His education is highly relevant, and he is in the advanced stages of his bachelor's degree, meeting the internship requirements. He also has international exposure and a clear motivation for the automotive sector and BMW specifically.\",\n",

German language skills are at a beginner level (A1), which may be a minor limitation for integration in some teams, though not a strict requirement. No explicit mention of experience in automotive series software development, but strong adjacent experience in industrial and process automation.',\n",

Continue improving German language proficiency to enhance integration and communication within the team.

He meets and exceeds most requirements, brings relevant technical and soft skills, and demonstrates a strong cultural fit and motivation for the company.
