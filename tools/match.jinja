            – No clear overlap goes to 0% – 7%

    - Red Flag Penalty (-10%). Apply deduction logic post-scoring.
        - Job hopping (e.g., <1 year repeatedly, EXCEPT FOR INTERNSHIPS).
        - Gaps with no explanation.
        - Language inconsistency or vague statements.

    - Final Composite Score (0–100) Can be categorized as
        - 80–100: Top Tier — Strong match, fast-track for recruiter review.
        - If Industry Alignment lt 8 and Hard‑Skill Match leq 15, flag as Domain‑Mismatch and cap Final Score at 79 (cannot enter “Top‑Tier”).
        - 60–79: Moderate Tier — Requires human review for context.
        - <60: Low Tier — Likely not a fit unless niche role.
